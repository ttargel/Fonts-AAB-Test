# Fonts-AAB-Test

In this project we were tasked with studying user behaviour in a company's app. The company is interested in trying to boost its revenue by changing the app's fonts, but is concerned this might be an intimidating change that would actually cause the opposite effect.

That's why an A/A/B test was called in. A certain amount of users has been picked, and users were split into three groups - two control groups, users of which were monitored while using the app having its current font set, and one test group, users of which were shown the new fonts. The test has been going on for some time, and now the company wants to know whether the new fonts were beneficial or did they have adverse effects. Or, maybe, neither?

In this project, we have used the following libraries/modules:

<ul>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>datetime</li>
  <li>plotly</li>
  <li>statsmodels.stats.proportion</li>
</ul>

Note: due to technical limitations, the plots generated by the Plotly library appear in the notebook above as pictures, not actual interactive graphs. Running the code above them will produce the same graphs.
